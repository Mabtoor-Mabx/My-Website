    <p>It is D Nature's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
      website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://D-Nature.com">https://D-Nature.com</a> (hereinafter,
      "us", "we", or "https://D-Nature.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
      identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
      Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
      circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we
      collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules
      and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be
      required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>Like most website operators, D Nature collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
      browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
      the date and time of each visitor request. D Nature's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
      is to better understand how D Nature's visitors use its website. From time to time, D Nature may release
      non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
      its website.</p>
    <p>D Nature also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
      logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://D-Nature.com blog posts. D Nature only discloses logged
      in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below.</p>

    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Certain visitors to D Nature's websites choose to interact with D Nature in ways that require D Nature to gather
      personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that D Nature gathers depends on the nature
      of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://D-Nature.com to provide a
      username and email address.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over
      the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means
      to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
      cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
      information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
      deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the
      use of cookies by D Nature and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
